###  Software Developer

A software developer with experience in building web applications using modern front-end and back-end technologies. I work with React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Bootstrap for front-end development, and Express.js, PHP, Firebase, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Node.js for back-end solutions. 

I focus on writing clean, efficient code and building secure, maintainable applications. My knowledge of C# allows me to work across diverse development environments, contributing to everything from small-scale projects to enterprise-level applications. I enjoy learning new technologies and improving my skills to create reliable and scalable software solutions.
